# Movie-recommendation-System-based-on-reviews

## Aim :
  Was to find the movies based on the reviews.
## Theory:
  For recommendation System I have used Collaborative Filtering. I have taken data from kaggle and added the data in the repository.
  This system works on the property that movies which have high correlation and have rating count > 100 will be counted for the recommended list.
## Technology Stack used:
### Language:
    ```Python```
 
### Framework:
  ```Jupyter Notebook```
### Libraries used:
  ```Numpy and pandas Inbuilt Libraries.
  Used Matplotlib and seaborn for Datavisualization and diagram.
  Used Python Dataframe for cleaning the data and make the dataset suitable to our requirements.
  Used movies Liar Liar and Silence of The Lamb for finding the best possible recommendation List.```
